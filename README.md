# VPython-Earth-Doughnut-Animation
This is exactly what it sounds like. I this animation in which the earth is a doughnut and orbits the sun, the moon is a doughnut and orbits the earth in figure 8s (through the center of the earth doughnut), and the sun can either be a sphere or a doughnut. This isn't very useful, but it's very entertaining

P.S. Because of how VPython works, it will open a browser on your computer to run the animation. However, the program talks directly to the browser, so you don't need to be connected to the internet to run the animation.
